ðŸŒŒ Fractol

Fractol is a C program that visualizes stunning fractals like Mandelbrot and Julia sets in real-time. Explore the beauty of math and graphics in an interactive way!

ðŸ”¹ About Fractals

The term fractal was first introduced by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. It comes from the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured". A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, such as a curve or surface, whose pattern remains consistent at every scale.

Fractals are not just theoreticalâ€”they appear in nature too, for example in the Romanesco cabbage, snowflakes, coastlines, and lightning bolts.
